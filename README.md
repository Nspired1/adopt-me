# Adopt Me

## A React tutorial

This app pulls data from a fake pet adoption API with fake data to present to the user different animals to adopt. The data from the API populates different components for the user to interact with to get a list of dogs, cats, or animals to adopt. Clicking through the pet will bring the user to a real adoption site called Pet Finder.

This simple app is practice using a React tutorial, covering React fundamentals, Class components, Functional components, Hooks, Context, React Router, Modals, Error Boundaries, Tailwind CSS, code splitting, server side rendering, Parcel, and some Babel.

Additionally for style and linting format, the app has setup files for Prettier and ES Lint.
